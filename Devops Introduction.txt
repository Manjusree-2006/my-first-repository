Devops Introduction:
         
  Devops = Development + operations
its a culture+set of practices+tools that help:
 Developers(who write code)
operations(who deploy/manage systems)
 Work together,instead of working in silos
real-time example:
Imagine you're building a mobile app like Swiggy.
The  developer writes code to add "Track My Order" feature.
Without Devops: Developer gives code to ops team -> they manually deploy -> bugs happen -> delays.
With Devops: code is automatically tested and deployed -> customers get updates faster and safely.
Devops helps you:
 Release features faster (like adding new payment methods in Zomato)
Fix bugs quickly (like fixing login issues in IRCTC)
Automate repetitive task (like server restart, database backups)
  
  plan - Define what to build
  Develop - write the code
  Build -Compile code into deployable format
  Test - 
  Release- Approve the build for deployment
  Deploy - push app to
  Operate keep app running, fix any issues
  Monitor analyze performance and feedback
 GitHub Basics:
 What is git & GitHub?
Git = version control system (local)

GitHub = online platform to store git projects
